# Face Painting Website Project

I created this simple face painting website during 2020 for a friend to upskill in HTML and CSS.
The site has had many of its images stripped and references to the origonal website owner removed for privacy reasons.

**NOTE:** This website is over 4 years old and is no longer representative of my web-dev skills.

## Features

- Basic responsivity.
- Basic image gallery (Featuring expanding images and 'return to top' button).
- Custom loading icon.
- Custom Instagram and Facebook 'roll out' buttons.
- PHP driven contact forms (Now disconnected for privacy reasons).
- Page position based animation via JavaScript.
- Custom scroll bar.
